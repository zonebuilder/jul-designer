          Designer is a <a target="_blank"
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development">RAD</a>
          tool used to visually build a JavaScript application.<br />
          Given a component based application running in an event-driven
          environment, JUL Designer helps you to generate the component
          tree with the attached event listeners. It also generates the
          JavaScript code for the current component tree.<br />

          <h3>Installation</h3>
          <p>Unpack the distribution archive to a directory of your web
            site. If necessary, give the web server process write
            permissions over the 'assets' directory (e.g. on Linux type
            as root: <code>chmod 777 assets</code> or <code>chown
              www-data assets</code>). Navigate to the installation
            directory using a web browser. The examples and other assets
            will be automatically installed with the first use of the
            application.</p>

      <div id="app-modules" class="section">
        <h2>Application, modules and projects</h2>
        <p>An application is an HTML page that loads a set of style and
          script resources to render a complete and useful user
          interface (UI). The parts of the UI that have an autonomous
          structure and behavior are called modules and usually reside
          inside separate source files. In JUL Designer, a module is a
          separate JavaScript file that generates a part of the UI. The
          module has a specific parser that iterates over a
          configuration tree to generate the interface. More details
          about generation of UI from a configuration can be found in
          the articles about JUL.<br />
          You can create an application from the "New application ..."
          menu. The default parser configuration of the application will
          be copied for any new module using the 'Switch module' menu.
          The application has a customizable template page that loads
          the module scripts in the appropriate order. It also has an
          initialization routine that can be customized and that, by
          default, calls each module's parser to create the module UI.<br />
          A module is identified by a namespace which is a dotted string
          representing the path to the JavaScript configuration root
          object of the module. The namespace can start with a dot,
          meaning that it is relative to the application's namespace.
          Each module corresponds to one JUL Designer project which is
          used to visually build the module source file. When switching to
          a new module, the 'New project' dialog appears to facilitate
          the creation of the project associated with the module.<br />

      <h2>Building a new project</h2>
      <p>A project is a component tree that, when instantiated, creates
        the JavaScript application.<br />
        In order to achieve this, JUL Designer generates the required
        JavaScript code on the fly, at every step when you are building
        the project. You can see and copy the code from the menu Project
        -&gt; View JavaScript.<br />
        Adding components to the component tree requires that you also
        configure the current framework to work with. To do this, please
        take a look at the topic about frameworks.<br />

        <h3>Choosing a template</h3>
        <p>A template is an HTML page used to generate live testing of
          the project. The page accepts several template variables that
          are replaced server-side with the actual values. Besides these

      <div id="framework-relation" class="section-2">
        <h3>Relation with a project</h3>
        <p>Using a framework allows the user to add its components to
          the current project. The available components will appear in
          the 'Add component' scroll box. Also, if the framework
          specifies the means to get the component bounding rectangle,
          the component tree and the test panel will visually hint the
          selected component with a red rectangle.<br />
          The current framework will filter the list of available
          components in the 'Add component' scroll box depending on the
          selected component in the project.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="framework-configuration" class="section-2">
        <h3>Configuring a framework</h3>
        <p>The framework settings are:<br />

        <ul>
          <li>title (string) - the title of the framework</li>
          <li>ns (string) - a unique dotted path representing the
            JavaScript namespace of the framework</li>
          <li>prependNS (boolean) - if true, the components will be
            added to the project with their full namespace as the class
            name. This has no effect if the project is using tags.</li>
          <li>getBoundingRect (function) - a custom function that gets
            the component instance as the parameter and returns its
            bounding rectangle</li>
            <li>augments (string) - if present, the current framework 
			will inherit the component configs from that. 
			Can be cascaded miltiple times.</li>
        </ul>
        The framework components are managed from the 'Components' tab.
        Several members of a component configuration can inherit from
        similar members of one or more components. These inheritable
        members are: 'getBoundingRect', 'members', 'events.<br />
        The members of a component configuration are:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>description (string) - component description</li>
          <li>restictParent array)_ - a name or an array of component
            names that can be the parent of the current component.
            Special value 'document' indicate the body element of the
            HTML page.</li>
          <li>inherits (string) - a name or an array of component names
            this component inherits from. All the component members and
            events will be calculated through inheritance when the
            component is added to the project's component tree.</li>
          <li>getBoundingRect (string) - the name of the component
            method or a custom function that returns its bounding
            rectangle. This inherits from the 'inherits' property and
            replaces the global function of the framework if specified.<br />
          </li>
        </ul>
        The descriptions of the component members and events are managed
        in the 'Members' and 'Events' tabs for each component.<br />
        For a component member, the description is:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>name (string) - member name</li>
          <li>description (string) - member description</li>
          <li>logic (boolean) - whether the member belongs to the logic

      <h2>Advanced topics</h2>
      <p>JUL Designer uses a JUL parser to render the component tree. To
        better understand using the designer, one should get accustomed
        with the parser specifics.<br />
      </p>
      <div id="separation" class="section-2">
        <h3>UI and logic separation</h3>
        <p>By default, a project separates the UI and logic members of
          each component into two properties of the project named 'ui'
          and 'logic'. The separation can be turned off from the project
          settings or on the fly from the menu Project -&gt; Don't
          separate logic.<br />
          The 'ui' property of the project contains the c9components as
          a tree of configuration objects. Each configuration object may
          have an ID or a binding ID which links the object with its
          logic part.<br />
          The 'logic' property of the project is a configuration object
          which has properties named the same as the IDs of the
          configuration objects in the 'ui' property. Inside these logic
          configuration objects, the designer puts all the members of
          the component marked as logic. Also, the listeners property
          goes in this place if not empty.<br />
          If the separation is turned off for some components, all their
          members go to the 'ui'&nbsp; property of the project.<br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="tag" class="section-2">
        <h3>Class and tag names</h3>
        <p>There are two categories of frameworks the parser and,
          consequently, the designer works with: the frameworks where
          components are class instances, and XML based languages where
          components are identified by tags.<br />
          For the first category, the class name of a component is the
          name from the component configuration, optionally prefixed
          with the namespace of the framework (if prependNS is true).
          This name is also displayed as the label of the component in
          the component tree panel.<br />
          For the second category, the class name is always the XML
          namespace of the framework (e.g. 'html', 'svg', 'xul' etc.). In
          addition, each component has a tag property which is the
          component name from the framework. The 'prependNS' setting is
          ignored, but, in the component tree panel, the components with
          a different XML namespace than the default class of the
          project are prefixed with their class name and a colon (e.g.
          'svg:path' ).<br />
          For both categories, if a component has the same class as the
          default class of the project, the class property will be
          stripped from the component configuration.<br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="namespaces" class="section-2">
        <h3>Namespaces</h3>
        <p>Both projects and frameworks are uniquely identified with
          their JavaScript namespaces.<br />
          A namespace is a string of identifiers or integers separated
          with dots.<br />
          Starting from the global object in the page (i.e. the window),
          these segments separated by dots are objects that can be found
          by resolving the current segment as the property of the
          current object.<br />
          The project uses its namespace to generate and to separate its
          JavaScript code from the other scripts. The project namespace
          also has the following properties:<br />
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>'parserConfig' - the parser configuration</li>
          <li>'ui' - the UI part of the project</li>
          <li>'logic' - the logic part of the project</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The framework namespace is mostly informative to what
          concerns the generated code, but may be used to construct a
          full class name for the components.<br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <div><a class="to-top" href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
    </div>
    <div id="interface" class="section">
      <h2>Elements of the interface</h2>
      <p>The interface manipulates JavaScript objects, so, some elements
        are specific to that scope.<br />
        Editing operations (copy, cut, paste, remove etc.), all work
        with JavaScript objects, aiming complete control over the
        generated code.<br />
      </p>
      <div id="value-box" class="section-2">
        <h3>The value box</h3>
        <p>Several parts of the interface have a 'Value' column with
          value boxes, one for each row. The type of value box depends
          on the JavaScript type of the value behind it.<br />
          The types of value boxes are:<br />
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>editable text box - for JavaScript types 'String' and
            'Number'</li>
          <li>check box - for JavaScript type 'Boolean'</li>
          <li>read-only text box - for the rest of JavaScript types</li>
        </ul>
        When possible. the text for complex types is displayed in a
        friendly format.<br />
        If a field is empty but it has a default value, the text box
        will hint that value as italics text.<br />
        For the fields with read-only box, the only means of editing is
        the code button next to the value box.<br />
      </div>
      <div id="code-dialog" class="section-2">
        <h3>The code dialog</h3>
        <p>The values in the value boxes can also be edited using the
          code buttons (...) in the 'Code' column. This launches the
          code dialog that allows editing a JavaScript expression.<br />
          You may fill any JavaScript code that evaluates to a valid
          expression. If the type of resulting value differs from the
          original, the corresponding value box will reflect the change.<br />
          Clearing the dialog box will delete the object member unless
          the field has a required default value which, in that case,
          will be assigned to the member.<br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="find-name" class="section-2">
        <h3>The find box and the name box</h3>
        <p>At the top of the component tree, near the buttons 'Up',
          'Down', 'Remove', 'Find', there is the find text box. It
          performs a cyclic search for the next component with an ID or
          a binding ID the same as that entered in the box.<br />
          At several parts in the interface, near the buttons 'Add',
          'Remove', 'Change', there is the name text box. It acts on the
          items of the list box in the selected tab below. If an item is
          selected and you press 'Enter' in the name text box, the item
          name will change if possible. If no item is selected or if you
          press 'Shift+Enter' a new item is added. If the name isn't
          valid, it will be automatically generated.<br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="component-selects" class="section-2">
        <h3>The Component select boxes</h3>
        <p>At the top of the component tree, there is a series of three
          select boxes that spells: "Show 'children' in 'UI' as
          'Array'".<br />
          The first select box chooses what category of descendents to
          show for the current component.<br />
          The second select box changes the belonging of the previous
          category either to UI or to logic.<br />
          The third select box changes the type of selected category
          either to 'Array' or to 'Object'. Look at the generated
          JavaScript to see the results.<br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="copy-paste" class="section-2">
        <h3>Copy, paste and undo operations</h3>
        <p>The copy, cut, paste, remove operations are split in two
          groups. First group operates on the components in the
          component tree, the second one processes the members of a
          component.<br />
          A component is copied and pasted with all its descendant
          components. Also, any operation in the component tree takes a
          component together with its sub-tree.</p>
        <p>The copy-paste operations on the component members allow
          copying and pasting multiple members to any component in the
          project. They exclude however certain special properties
          meaningful to the JUL parser such as: the class, the tag, the
          children property, other 'members' properties, ID properties.<br />
          The undo operation undoes the last altering operation
          regardless of its kind.<br />
